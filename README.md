## 1. Project Overview

The "forchp" project is a dynamic web application built using React and Next.js 14, with TypeScript for type safety and Redux Toolkit for state management. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable.

### Key Technologies:
- **React 18**
- **Next.js 14**
- **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **Yarn**

# Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/forchp.git
   cd forchp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This will start the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building the Project

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
After building, you can start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## 3. Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is crucial for efficient development:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application logic, including pages, layouts, and forms.
  - **`(pages)/`**: Individual pages, such as `myapplications` and `serviceCataloge`.
  - **`services/`**: Dynamic routes for different services.
  - **`forms/`**: Specialized forms related to various services.
- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components (e.g., `header`, `footer`, `attachments`).
- **`config/`**: Configuration files and models (e.g., `application.modal.tsx`, `service.model.tsx`).
- **`services/`**: API service files for handling external data (e.g., `fetchWithAuth.tsx`, `getApplication.tsx`).
- **`store/`**: Redux store setup and slices.
- **`lookups/`**: Services related to fetching and processing lookup data.
- **`public/`**: Static assets such as images and icons.
- **Configuration Files**: `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.

## 4. Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all components, services, and utility functions.
- **ESLint**: Follow the configured ESLint rules for consistent code formatting.
- **Prettier**: Ensure code is formatted using Prettier before committing.

### Component Development

- **Reusable Components**: Place reusable components in the `components/` directory.
- **Props Typing**: Strongly type all props in components using TypeScript interfaces or types.
- **Modular Structure**: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.

### State Management

- **Redux Toolkit**: Use slices for state management. Place slices in `store/slices/`.
- **Selectors**: Use selectors to retrieve data from the store.
- **Thunk Actions**: For asynchronous actions, use Redux Thunk integrated with the slices.

### API Services

- **Service Files**: Encapsulate API calls in service files located in the `services/` directory.
- **Axios**: Use Axios for making HTTP requests.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in service functions.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility classes provided by Tailwind for styling components.
- **Global Styles**: Define global styles in `app/globals.css`.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure components are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

### Testing

- **Jest**: Use Jest for unit testing components and utilities.
- **React Testing Library**: Use this library for testing React components.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage across the project.

## 5. Deployment

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in a `.env` file in the root directory. These variables will be accessible in both client and server environments.

### Production Build

To deploy the application:
1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build.
2. Start the server with `npm run start`.

For serverless deployment, follow the Next.js guidelines for deploying to Vercel, AWS, or other platforms.

## 6. Best Practices

- **Component Reusability**: Avoid duplicating code; use existing components where possible.
- **State Management**: Centralize complex state in Redux and keep components stateless where possible.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully, especially in API calls and user inputs.
- **Performance**: Optimize components and pages for performance. Use Next.js features like `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` wisely.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Dependency Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- **Build Failures**: Check the build output for errors related to TypeScript, ESLint, or other tools.
- **API Errors**: Verify that environment variables are set correctly and that API endpoints are reachable.

### Debugging Tips

- **Console Logs**: Use `console.log` for quick debugging in development.
- **React DevTools**: Use React DevTools to inspect component states and props.
- **Redux DevTools**: Use Redux DevTools to monitor state changes.

## 8. Contributing

### Git Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature X"
   ```
3. **Pull Requests**: Submit a pull request to the `main` branch once the feature is complete.

### Code Review

- **Peer Review**: All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- **Merge Policy**: Only merge after approval and passing all CI checks.

### Contribution Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Update documentation (e.g., README, comments) when making changes.
- **Testing**: Ensure all changes are covered by unit tests.

## Conclusion

This guide should provide you with everything you need to effectively work on the "forchp" project. Whether you're setting up the project, developing new features, or debugging issues, following this guide will help maintain code quality and consistency.

Happy coding!
